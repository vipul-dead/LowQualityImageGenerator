# LowQualityImageGenerator

When embarking on a new machine learning project, sourcing an appropriate image dataset can be a challenging endeavor. This challenge becomes particularly pronounced in the realm of Generative AI, where technologies such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are employed to generate images. One recurring obstacle arises from the computational demands imposed by high-quality images within datasets, leading to difficulties in successfully executing these neural network architectures.

To address this prevalent issue, a viable strategy involves the utilization of tools that generate low-quality images. These images serve as a foundational step in the machine learning pipeline, enabling subsequent processing to refine them into shapes that align with the specific requirements of the user. This approach not only mitigates the computational burden associated with high-quality images but also facilitates a more seamless integration of Generative AI technologies into diverse machine learning applications.
